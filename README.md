# Cross-tissue gene expression interactions from bulk, single cell and spatial transcriptomics with crossWGCNA

crossWGCNA is an open-source R package for the unsupervised identification of inter-tissue interactions from bulk, single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data. 
We employed crossWGCNA for the analysis of bulk RNA-seq data from laser-capture microdissected stroma and epithelium, single-cell RNA-seq data and spatial transcriptomics, 
for studying the tumour-stroma cross-talk in breast cancer.
